- Add blue energy: "nuclear power should be prioritized by deregulation still ensuring safety".
- Explain better the welfare trap:
  - Proposal #1: "The welfare system should be minimal and help people get better financially without holding them back. The "Welfare Trap" occurs when earning more causes people to lose benefits, so people are enticed to stay at their current situation instead of advancing; the goal is to encourage progress without making citizens worse off."
- Neutrality and peace requires a strong military.
