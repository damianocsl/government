# My proposal for a better government

https://damianocasula.com/government

## Ideas

- Add blue energy: "nuclear power should be prioritized by deregulation still ensuring safety".
- Explain better the welfare trap:
  - Proposal #1: "The welfare system should be minimal and help people get better financially without holding them back. The "Welfare Trap" occurs when earning more causes people to lose benefits, so people are enticed to stay at their current situation instead of advancing; the goal is to encourage progress without making citizens worse off."
- Neutrality and peace requires a strong military.
- Minimal taxes, maximum government efficiency
- Government does not impolement citizen surveilance
- Privacy and  of citizens data handled by public services
- No requirement of identification by police if there is no illegal act in action, and police should not be able to stop anyone without any reason
  - Italian law says:
    - Art. 651 Penal Code - Anyone who, requested by a public official in the exercise of his duties, refuses to give information on his personal identity, his status, or other personal qualities, is punished with arrest until one month or with a fine of up to 206 euros.
    - Art. 4 TULPS - The public security authority is authorized to order that dangerous or suspicious persons to prove their identity and those who are unable or refuse to prove their identity be subjected to mug shots.
    - Article 6 Consolidated Immigration Act - 3. A foreigner who, at the request of public security officers and agents, fails to comply, without a justifiable reason, with an order to produce a passport or other identification document and a residence permit or other document proving lawful presence in the territory of the State shall be punished by arrest of up to one year and a fine of up to 2,000 euros.
  - My proposal is: if there is no suspition or danger - police shouldn't be able to stop someone.
- No illegal immigration, only through legal ways defined by the law, Polish style.
